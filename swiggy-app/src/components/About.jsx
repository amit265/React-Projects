        Founded in 2023 by John Doe, Swiggy Clone has come a long way from its beginnings in a home office. When John first started out, his passion for "eco-friendly cleaning products" drove him to quit his day job, do tons of research, so that Swiggy Clone can offer you the world's most advanced food delivery service. We now serve customers all over the world and are thrilled that we're able to turn our passion into our own website.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">
        We hope you enjoy our service as much as we enjoy offering them to you. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400 mb-4">Sincerely,</p>
